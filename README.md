# Neon White Discord Leaderboard
This is a bot that intends to improve the experience of racing against your server members. I think it's annoying to have to click through every stage, just to check if someone has beaten my times. Our current workaround to this is posting a screenshot in a specified channel, but images are difficult to search for. Thus, you can't quickly check, if that one level you're really proud of has been beaten. This bot aims to improve that experience with the help of commands, to quickly check the status of a stage or user.

### Current version:
The current version of this bot is very much still in development and doesn't really offer any usable feature.

### TODOs
- [ ] Implement timekeeping, the main feature LUL
- [ ] Add a list of available commands
- [ ] Add instructions on how to set up
- [ ] Allow for confirmation after a user submits a new time
  - [ ] Allow for confirmation only after placing better than specified place
- [ ] Improve usability to broaden the usecase of this bot (eg. Trackmania)
